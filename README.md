With the NodeJS fs module, write a script that creates a scaffold for a frontend project with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

 

Your script should create a folder named “frontend-scaffold”. Inside side the frontend-scaffold folder, your script should do the following:

 

1. Create an index.html file and fill it with the following:
 
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">

<head>

<meta charset="UTF-8">

<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

<link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/style.css">

<title>Document</title>

</head>

<body>

<h1>Welcome</h1>

<script src="./js/script.js"></script>

</body>

</html>

 

2. Create a folder names “css” and create a file inside the folder named “style.css”. The style.css file should contain the following:

 

h1 {

text-align:center;

}

 

3. Create a folder named “js” and create a file inside the folder named “script.js”. The script.js file should contain the following:

 

alert("Welcome");

 

4. Create a folder named “images”.

 

5. Your code should log out “Frontend scaffold created successfully!” after creating all the necessary files and folders.
